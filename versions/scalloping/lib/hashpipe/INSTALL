To build HASHPIPE from a freshly cloned repository you need to have autoconf
anf automake and libtool installed.  Once those are in place, your can run the
following commands to build HASHPIPE:

$ cd src
$ autoreconf -is
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install

Instead of "sudo make install", you can also run "make staging", which will
perform a local install to a directory named "staging" under the "src"
subdirectory.
